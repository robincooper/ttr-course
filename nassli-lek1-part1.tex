which can characterize the potential for misunderstanding, rejection,
and correction.

2. plan of course
(a) eliminate slides 1-16. Keep: 17-25. eliminate: 26-43. keep: 44-61. That's < 30 slides.
If one wanted, one cd also add as a bit of extra data slides 12-15.
If not, the alternative is to add a couple of slides wrapped around slide 22 (the slide titled Pay Off) because we need a slide or three where we  present some of the amazing problems we plan to solve.

\bit
\item
There are a large variety of views on the nature of grammar. 

\item And they
play an inevitable role in debates on the nature of how language
evolved (see e.g.\
\cite{pinker1992natural,fch02,chater-language}). 

\item Chomsky
(\cite{chomsky-kl,chomsky2000nhs}): grammar is best seen as a
disembodied, decontextualized combinatorial system, which interfaces
with phonological and semantic modules. 

\item Various alternative frameworks
have been developed, which following Montague, give equal weight
to a semantic component
(\cite{montague73,ps94,dalrymple-gluebook,steedman:book,culicover2005ss})
or even `devalue' the pivotal role of syntax
(\cite{langacker-fcg}).

Whether to integrate {\it context} as a separate dimension of
grammar---first broached by the generative
semanticists in the early 1970s (see e.g.\  Jerry Morgan's
seminal 1973 paper (\cite{morgan73})). 

\item A restricted notion of context,
enabling some aspects of the meaning of noun phrases to be captured,
has been integrated within various grammatical frameworks, following the
seminal work of Kamp and Heim  (\cite{heim82,kamp81,kampreyle93}).
\item Commonly acknowledged (following Montague
  Kaplan Cresswell, Situation Semantics) though the precise mechanism is less clear:
the need for grammar to make reference to an utterance situation in order to accommodate the meaning
of indexicals such as `I', `You', `Here', and `Now' is commonly
assumed.

`Here', and `Now' need to be accommodated by the grammar

links up: the external world, grammar, and interaction.


\item Fundamental to KoS is the dynamic strategy to meaning, pioneered by
Stalnaker, Lewis ,Kamp, Heim, Barwise, Groenendijk and Stokhof et al---the
meaning of a linguistic form is explicated in terms of the effect its
use has on existing commonly shared contextual ``resources''.  

\item  This suggests 
thinking of context as structured by resources which conversational participants keep 
track of, as demonstrated by linguistic evidence.

\item Working out what these resources are and how to model interaction
in their terms will be a focus of lectures 3 and 4.

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{From Communitarian Semantics to the Interactive Stance}

\begin{itemize}

\item Semantics as practised highly productively since Frege:
\begin{itemize} \item characterizing {\it successful communication}:
\bit
\item {\it the proposition expressed by a sentence in context}
\item {\it the referent of an NP}
\item {\it anaphoric/presuppositional potential}
\eit
\item abstracting away from individual differences, from the
{\it communicative process}
\end{itemize}
\item {\it Communitarian Semantics}
\end{itemize}

\frametitle{From Communitarian Semantics to the Interactive Stance}

\bit

\ignore{\item We have already seen data that requires one
  to interleave the communicative process into the semantics---the
  NSUs in (\ref{nsu-in-gram1}). 
}

\item A variety of data  we will see today will lead us to propose an
  alternative, more general perspective to our semantic
  enterprise---the {\sf interactive stance}. 

\item The {\sf interactive
    stance} involves taking seriously the fact that communication
  involves multiple agents with distinct beliefs and desires and
  places importance on explicating the potential for misunderstanding,
  rejection, and correction, as well as success.

\eit

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{From Communitarian Semantics to the Interactive Stance}

\begin{itemize}

\item
  Adopting the {\sf interactive stance} will allow us to incorporate
  into  formal semantic theory insights from two important bodies of work.

\item  Conversation Analysis (e.g.\ \cite{sjs77,schegloff87}), which lead
  the way in recognizing the fundamental importance of {\it repair}, and
 
\item  Clarkian psycholinguistics (e.g.\ \cite{clark96}), which has offered
  detailed documentation of {\it grounding}---the process by means of
  which content becomes part of the common ground.

\item The (or um a) basic requirement
on semantic theory:

 \textcolor[rgb]{0.98,0.00,0.00}{The
  ability to characterize for any utterance type the update that
  emerges in the aftermath of successful grounding and the full range

    assumptions }

\ignore{
\begin{itemize}

\item {\sf Contextualized Lewisian Regularity}: whenever A utters $S$ 
with meaning $\mu$ in $c$, A communicates that P, where P = $\mu[f]$, 
$f$ is the assignment $c$ provides for $\mu$, and B acquires the 
belief that P. 

\item {\sf Equal Access to Context:}  As a
conversation proceeds a common ground emerges: A has her turn, reaches
a transition relevance point (TRP); Then either A proceeds or B takes
over {\bf from the common ground point at which A spoke.}


\item {\sf The supra-contextual nature of Semantics}: Semantics 
associates meanings with sentences and constituents of sentences.

\end{itemize}
}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{ Meaning v.\  Content}

\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Meaning v.\ Content} (Montague, Kaplan, Bar Hillel, Cresswell, Barwise and Perry):
\begin{itemize} \item {\em
  character/meaning},  associated with sentences or types of
utterances, 

\item {\it content/interpretation},  associated with sentences--in--context or utterances.
\end{itemize}
\pause
\item   The basic task of a
semantic analysis--- specify the meanings associated
with expressions (platonic entities, unlocated in
space or time).  
\ignore{\item A meaning of an expression $E$--- a rule which allows a conversationalist to
calculate, given a context $c$, what content is associated with $E$ in
$c$.  
}
\pause
\item Alternative construal:  a meaning---associated with an utterance type, where an utterance is a
spatio-temporally located event involving the sequential enunciation
of one or more words.
\pause
\item This perspective proffered originally in
\cite{bp83,gp90,cp94,poesio98}), but has generally aroused scant interest.

\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{ Meaning v.\  Content}

\begin{itemize}


\item {\it The supra-contextual nature of Semantics}: Semantics 
associates meanings with expressions.



\item This notion of a meaning as a contextual use rule can be formalized as 
a function from {\it contexts} to {\it contents}.    
(\ref{meaning-ex1}) is a simple example of a meaning construed 
as a function:

\eeen{\label{meaning-ex1}
\item I hear you.
\item f: c $\mapsto$ Hear(s,a,t), where s is the speaker in c, a is 
the addressee and t overlaps with the time of c.
}

\end{itemize}

\end{frame}
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Equal Access to Context }

\begin{itemize}


\item {\it Equal Access to Context:} As a conversation proceeds 
a shared context (the {\it common ground}) emerges: A has her turn, 
reaches a transition relevance point (TRP); Then either A 
proceeds or B takes over {\it from the common ground point at which A 
spoke.}.

\item (\ref{cg1}) exemplifies why {\sf Equal Access} seems a plausible 
assumption: A makes an initial utterance, a query, which either A or B 
can follow up on:

\eeen{\label{cg1}
\item A(1): Who should we invite to the conference?
\item A(2): Perhaps Noam, huh?
\item B(2): Perhaps Noam, huh?}




\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{ Lewisian Regularities}

\begin{itemize}


\item Simplifying somewhat,  Lewis (1968) proposes that
a regularity as described below is what underlies the
communicative process involved in conveying `literal import':

\eeen{
\item[] Original Lewisian regularity: 
 Whenever S is uttered, the utterer intends to communicate P and the
hearer acquires the belief P.
}

\item  Now
(\ex{0}) won't work for sentences whose (literal) import
varies with context, the lion's share of actually used sentences. 

\item So replace it with:


\eeen{\item[] Contextualized  Lewisian regularity: Whenever A utters $S$ with meaning $\mu$ in a 
context $c$, A communicates that P, where P = $\mu[f]$, $f$ is the 
assignment $c$ provides for $\mu$, and B acquires the belief that P. }



\end{itemize}

\end{frame}



\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Communitarian Semantics: some
    assumptions }

\begin{itemize}
\item Montague: {\it I fail
to see any great interest in syntax except as a preliminary to
semantics.}  

\item Generally true of formal accounts of context
change (e.g.\ those formulated in Discourse Representation Theory
(\cite{kampreyle93}, in Dynamic Predicate Logic and its relatives
(e.g.\ \cite{gs91,dekker-rlc} and in Segmented Discourse
Representation Theory (\cite{al03}))), with the
important exception of Poesio and Traum's PTT:

\item {\sf Weak Montogovianism}: only the {\it content} of 
utterances ({\it not} their syntactic or phonological properties)
contributes information that persists in the context.

\begin{itemize}

\item (*) despite being a perfectly normal and unremarkable
conversation points to some very significant issues.

\item Damion spends just about the entire
conversation without a unique referent associated with `he', and `Sam'.

\item Hard to square with
the {\sf Contextualized Lewisian Regularity}: where a function gets
fed its value (a contextual tuple of some kind), yielding a content as
value, or no value whatever if something goes wrong.

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Communitarian Semantics: some
    problematic assumptions}

\begin{itemize}

\item This technical
quibble is a symptom of a far deeper malaise: with some notable
exceptions to be discussed below, linguistic semantics still operates
under the assumption that {\bf perfect communication}
obtains---nothing does go wrong and interpretation leads to an
identical update on Damian's and Terry's information states. 

\item involves giving up on trying to make sense of conversations such as
the above and most concretely the analysis of the meaning of NSUs there
such as `Who?', `Which Sam', and `Oh Fleckerstein or the other
one?') that express metacommunicative queries.

\item  The data in (\ex{1}) and
(\ex{2}), involving the resolution of NSUs, are incompatible with (the
above version of) {\sf Equal Access}. 

\item (\ex{1}) illustrates that the
contextual possibilities for resolving the fragment `Bo?' are distinct
for the speaker and the addressee:

\eeen{\label{ttp10}
\item A: Who does Bo admire? B: Bo? \\
Reading 1 (\textbf{ short answer}): Does Bo admire Bo?\\
Reading 2 (\textbf{clausal confirmation}): Are you
asking who BO (of all people) admires?;  \\
Reading 2 (\textbf{intended content }): Who do
you mean `Bo'?
\item  A: Who does Bo admire?  Bo? \\
Reading 1 (\textbf{ short answer}): Does Bo admire Bo?\\
Reading 2 (\textbf{self correction} Did I say `Bo'?)
}

\begin{itemize}


\item Fragments of this kind, henceforth {\it reprise fragments} (RFs) are
frequent: the \textbf{clausal confirmation}) and \textbf{intended
  content } readings constituting approximately 30\% of all
clarification requests in the British National Corpus.




\end{itemize}

\end{frame}
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Communitarian Semantics: some
  problematic  assumptions }

\begin{itemize}


\item (\ex{1}) is an even more striking illustration of the phenomenon we
have dubbed the Turn Taking Puzzle (TTP) (see
\cite{ginzburg-ac97}): here the resolution accorded to the bare
`Why?' changes according to who keeps or takes over the turn. 

\item (\ex{1}c) shows that these facts cannot be reduced to coherence or
plausibility---the resolution unavailable to A in (\ex{1}a) yields a
coherent follow up to A's initial query if it is expressed by means of
a non-elliptical form:



\eeen{
\item A: Which members of this audience own a parakeet?  Why?  (= Why own a 
parakeet?)  
\item A: Which members of this audience own a parakeet?  B: Why?  (= Why are you
asking which members of this audience own a parakeet?) 
\item A: Which members of this audience own a parakeet?  
Why am I asking this question?
}

\end{itemize}

\end{frame}
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Communitarian Semantics: some
  problematic  assumptions }

\begin{itemize}


\item The Turn Taking Puzzle vitiates {\sf Equal Access}, since it demonstrates in a rather
direct way that, at least some of the time, the contextual options
available to one participant are distinct from those available to the
other(s) participant(s).  




\item At the same time, the TTP is not an argument
for solipsism, for instance of a type advocated in Relevance Theory
(\cite{sperber-wilson86}), the only influential approach which
explicitly  avoids assuming {\sf Equal Access}. 

%(Though recent change in SDRT, see FIX).

\item  The TTP
reflects an asymmetry of production, not understanding: it seems clear
that both participants would understand the potential contributions of
the other.

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Utterances v. Sentences--in--context }

\begin{itemize}


\item The data in (\ref{utt1}) illustrates that if A makes the 
utterance in (\ref{utt1}(1)) a variety of facts about the utterance 
(in bold face in (2b-e)) potentially enter into the common ground. 


\item  (\ref{utt1}) 
exemplifies two classes of facts about the utterance that become 
presupposable, facts about the content of sub-utterances 
(\ref{utt1}(2b-d)) and also facts that concern solely the phonology 
and word order of the utterance. 


\eeen{\label{utt1} \item[]           

\noindent A(1): Did Mark send you a love letter?\\
B(2b): No, though it's interesting {\bf that you refer to Mark/my
brother/our friend}  \\     
B(2d): No, though it's interesting {\bf that you ask about Mark's epistolary
habits}\\ 
B(2e): No, though it's interesting {\bf that the final two words you 
just uttered start with `l'}
  }

\ignore{
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{ Utterances v. Sentences--in--context}

\begin{itemize}


\item The fact that non-semantic information such as phonology or word order
associated with an utterance needs to filter into the context and stay
there for a while $\not\rightarrow$  all equally {\it
  accessible}.

\item The lion's share of these facts cannot actually be
picked up in fact ellipsis/anaphora.  




 B(3a): (No, though) why? (= {\em why are you asking whether Mark sent me a
love letter}; cannot mean: {\em why do you refer to Mark/my brother/our
friend}, {\em why do you  bring up the sending of love letters} etc)

B(3b): (No, though) Don't you think that's a bit over inquisitive?
(`that' = {\em your asking me whether Mark sent me a love letter})


\item  facts that are easily accessible---{\it
  topical}. Hopefully get to this at the end of the course.

\item  A further
argument for this utterance-based perspective is that the
sub-utterance tokens figure in the content of CRs, as I will discuss
later on.

\begin{itemize}


\item We have already seen some data that goes against {\sf Weak
  Montogovianism}: the presuppositions about phonology and word order
that emerge in the aftermath of an utterance.

\item  An additional set of
phenomena are phonological and syntactic parallelism phenomena in CRs
and NSUs. 
\item Clausal Confirmation readings require
partial syntactic parallelism: an XP used to clarify an antecedent
sub-utterance $u_1$ must match $u_1$ categorially:



\eenumsentence{\label{para-ex11}
\item A: I phoned him. B: him? / {\#}he?
\item A: Did he phone you? B: he? / {\#}him?
\item A: Did he adore the book. B: adore? / {\#}adored? 
\item A: Were you cycling yesterday? B: Cycling?/biking?/{\#}biked?
}

\end{itemize}

\end{frame}
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Weak
  Montogovianism }

\begin{itemize}


\item The repetition reading of a RF involve (segmental) phonological 
identity with their source follows from their very nature (`Did you
say \ldots'). And this requirement also applies to
intended content  RFs: 

\eenumsentence{
\item[(i)] A: Did Bo leave? B: Max? (cannot mean: 
intended content reading: {\bf Who are you referring to?} or {\bf Who do you mean?})

 }


\item The persistence of non-semantic information in context is
 very much an empirical question, but discarding {\sf Weak
   Motogovianism} seems a necessary first step in accounting for a
 growing body of work in psycholinguistics that demonstrates the
 existence of non-semantically-based priming (see
 e.g.\ \cite{branigan00,garrodpickering04}).

knowledge of meaning includes knowledge of CRification possibilities.
In other words, an important benchmark for any
  semantic theory of dialogue is to accommodate as coherent and
 characterize the range of clarificatory   potential of utterances by
 an interlocutor.


\item {\bf Semantic non-determinism}: the contexts available to
  the conversationalists in the aftermath of an utterance are NOT
  identical, as illustrated by various turn taking puzzles. This
  entails a cognitive architecture in which there is no single common
  ground, but distinct yet coupled Dialogue GameBoards, one per conversationalist.

\item {\bf Fine-grained utterance representation}: information
  pertaining to syntactic and phonological aspects of an utterance
not merely the utterance's illocutionary
  {\it content}---on whatever theoretical explication of this
  concept---becomes  presupposed following a grounded
  utterance; This point has also been argued for extensively
    by Massimo Poesio, see
    e.g.\ \cite{potr97,poesio-rieser09}.
\item Also needed for an account of quotation (\cite{gc-quot12})..

\item  This requires a
means of keeping track of the sign information associated with an utterance
  in context after its successful processing. In turn, this necessitates a
  grammatical ontology that furnishes all this information in
  parallel---a {\it sign-based grammar} of some kind

and \cite{allwood-activity}, respectively.) and of {\it repair} (in
the sense of \cite{schegloff87}).

\item  The main claim that originates with
\cite{cs93} is that any dialogue move $m_{1}$ made by A must be
grounded (viz acknowledged as understood) by the other CP B before it
enters the common ground; failing this clarification interaction
(henceforth {\it CRification}) must ensue.

}

\item  A weakened version provides a
starting point---basic  need to interleave the potential for
grounding/CRification incrementally; the size of the increments being
an important empirical issue.

the ability to generate concrete predictions about forms/meanings of
MCI utterances in context.

\section{Communitarian Semantics for conversation: a sketch}


\begin{frame}
\frametitle{ The Semantics of  `yes'}

\begin{itemize}
\item The main difficulty in providing a formal description of `yes' is pinning down 
its contextual background.

\item Informal picture: when `yes' stands alone, it typically serves to affirm a proposition, 
one that has either been asserted or queried:

\eeen{\label{yes0}\item A: Did Suleyman the Magnificent
build the walls of Jerusalem? B: Yes.

\item A: Bo is finally leaving us tomorrow. B: Yes. It's a relief.

\item Robert(1):  It's quite  well established then, your   $\ldots$  uh
  $\ldots$ affair?  Emma(2): Yes.

\item Our affair is quite well established.  
  }

\item In (\ref{yes0}c(2)) Emma conveys to Robert (\ref{yes0}d). How does this come 
about?

\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{ The Semantics of  `yes'}

\begin{itemize}
\item The most obvious formal semantics account one 
could offer involves the following three components:

\ben

\item {\bf Meaning:} Emma and Robert know the {\it meaning} of `yes',  
which can be described tentatively as: {\it the proposition currently 
most salient in the context}.

\item {\bf Context:} Emma and Robert are jointly aware of the evolving 
context. In particular, they are both aware that as a result of 
Robert's query the truth or otherwise of {\em the affair is well established} 
became most salient in the context.

\item {\bf Content:} putting 1. and 2. together the content of Emma's 
utterance of `yes' emerges.
\een
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}




\begin{frame}
\frametitle{ Context: basic issues}

\begin{itemize}


\item Having spelled out some basic principles linking meaning, context, and 
content, there are two crucial inter-related issues we need to address
before we can actually spell out the meaning of `yes'. Simply put the 
issues are: 

\ben
\item How is context structured?

\item  How does context evolve?
\een


\end{itemize}

\end{frame}
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{ Contexts in KoS}

\begin{itemize}


\item The answer I will assume for these questions theory derives from work
in KoS

\item  Other
comprehensive accounts of a theory of context for dialogue include
work in the PTT framework (e.g.\
\cite{PoesioTraum97_Conversational,potr98,EDIS,poesio-rieser09}) and
work within Segmented Discourse Representation Theory (SDRT) (e.g.\
\cite{al03,al08}).

 

\end{itemize}

\end{frame}
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Contexts in KoS }

\begin{itemize}


\item in KoS, there is actually no single context, for
reasons that will soon emerge.

\item Instead of a single
context, analysis is formulated at a level of information states, one
per conversational participant. 

\item What the typed entities depicted in
  (\ex{1}),(\ex{2}) amount to is explained  in the next few lectures.

\item The type of information states
is given in (\ex{1}):

\eeen{\item[] TotalInformationState (TIS):

\ba
\[dialoguegameboard : DGB\\
private : Private
\]\ea
}


 

\end{itemize}

\end{frame}
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Contexts in KoS }

\begin{itemize}

\item The dialogue gameboard (DGB) represents information
that arises from publicized interactions and, for now, we can identify
it as the public context. 

\eeen{\item[]   DGB (initial definition)

                 \begin{avm}\[spkr: Ind\\
                             addr: Ind\\
                           c-utt : addressing(spkr,addr)\\
                        Facts : Set(Prop)\\
                           Moves : list(IllocProp)\\
                           QUD : poset(Question)\]\end{avm}

}



\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{The Dialogue GameBoard }

\begin{itemize}

\item The spkr/hearer roles serve to keep track of turn ownership.

\item {\bf FACTS} represents the shared knowledge conversationalists utilize during a
  conversation. More operationally, information  a
  conversationalist can use embedded under presuppositional operators.

\item {\bf MOVES}:  useful to single out LatestMove,
  a distinguished fact that characterizes  the most
  recent move made. 

\item The main motivation---to segregate from the
  entire repository of presuppositions  information on the basis of which
  coherent reactions could be computed.

\item  Later on see that keeping track of more than just
  the latest move can be useful.

\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{The Dialogue GameBoard }

\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf QUD}: (mnemonic for Questions Under Discussion)---questions that constitute a ``live issue''. That is,
  questions that have been {\em introduced for discussion} at a given
  point in the conversation and not yet been {\em downdated}. 

\item There are additional,
  indirect ways for questions to get added into QUD, the most
  prominent of which is during metacommunicative interaction.

\item   Being maximal in QUD ({\sc max-qud})
  corresponds to being the current `discourse topic' and is a key
  component in the theory.




\end{itemize}

\end{frame}
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{ The meaning of `yes'}

\begin{itemize}


\item We can 
hypothesize the following as the meaning of `yes':

\eeen{\label{yes2}
\item[]  {\it The proposition introduced by {\sc latest-move}
into the context}.
}

\item A cursory examination of any conversational corpus will attest that 
this description covers a high percentage of the occurrences of `yes'. 
 
\item Nonetheless, the description is intrinsically incomplete.

\frametitle{The meaning of `yes' }

\begin{itemize}


\item  One of the major claims advanced in KoS is that
QUD is a resource on the basis of which resolution of the various
distinct classes of non-sentential utterances (NSUs) can be
achieved. We will try to substantiate this in lectures 4 and 5.
\item  A simple example of this concerns our
quarry in this section, `yes'. We can propose the following as the
meaning for `yes':

\eeen{\label{yes-final0}
\item[] $p$, where $p?$ is maximal in {\sc qud}.
}

\item This will offer a uniform account of the cases we have seen sofar.

 \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{The meaning of `yes' }



\ben 
\item in 
those cases where `yes' is used to affirm the positive option in a 
polar question $p?$ (e.g.\ (\ref{yes0}a,c), (\ref{no-lm}), 
(\ref{no-lm1})) the polar question has been introduced to QUD as a 
consequence of the query act. 
\item  Although, other questions might have 
been introduced in the interim (as in (\ref{no-lm}), (\ref{no-lm1})), 
if the issues they raise are downdated from QUD, $p?$ will return to 
become QUD-maximal. 
\item  Similarly, in cases where `yes' is affirming a 
previously asserted proposition, the resolution builds on the presence 
of $p?$ in QUD as a consequence of an assertion.
